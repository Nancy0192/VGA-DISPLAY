# VGA-DISPLAY
This project is a Verilog based implementation on zedboard board. 
This project enables a range of image processing operations, focusing on convolution-based techniques, for a given input image. The image is transmitted to the FPGA Block RAM in binary format, and chosen image processing operations are executed based on user preferences. The resulting processed image is subsequently showcased on a VGA display. Verilog serves as the hardware description language for this project, and Python is utilized for converting digital images into binary form. The development process involves the use of the Vivado software suite.
